- [ ] 💬 Word-by-word synced lyrics (enhanced lyric display)
- [ ] 🔁 Last.fm integration (import most played songs, possibly export support too)
- [ ] 💿 Artist page improvements (differentiate albums and singles visually)
- [ ] 📺 Experimental Android TV support (maybe... if there's enough interest!)
